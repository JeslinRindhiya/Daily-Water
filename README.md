# Daily Water Intake Tracker – Hydration Monitoring Application

## Overview

Staying properly hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health and well-being, yet many people struggle to track their daily water intake. To address this, we’ve developed a **Daily Water Intake Tracker** – a simple and intuitive mobile application designed to help users monitor and manage their daily water consumption.

This application offers personalized reminders, tracks water intake throughout the day, and provides insights into hydration habits. With features like goal setting, progress visualization, and customizable notifications, the app aims to encourage healthy hydration habits by ensuring users meet their daily water intake goals.
